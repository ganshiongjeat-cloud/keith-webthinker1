Q2. Savings Simulator
============================================================
You are building a small savings simulator.
A person starts with a certain amount of money.

Every day, the person saves more money than the previous day:

Day 1 → save $1
Day 2 → save $2
Day 3 → save $3
Day 4 → save $4
… and so on

The program must:
- Ask for the starting amount of money.
- Ask for the number of days.
- For each day, add the correct savings amount.
- Print the total money after each day.
- Finally, print the final total amount.

Program Requirements:
- Use a for loop.
- Use range() correctly.
- Update the total amount inside the loop.
- Print exactly in this format:
    Day <X>: $<Y>
- After the loop, print:
    Total amount saved = $<Z>

Note:
- Follow the input order exactly as shown in the Test Cases.
- You must get the correct output for ALL 3 test cases.
